        "\n",
        "BASIC OVERVIEW:\n",
        "- Chess is a two-player game played on an 8x8 grid (board) with alternating dark and light squares.\n",
        "- Each player begins with 16 pieces: 1 king, 1 queen, 2 rooks, 2 bishops, 2 knights, and 8 pawns.\n",
        "- The player controlling the white pieces moves first.\n",
        "\n",
        "GOAL OF THE GAME:\n",
        "- The objective is to checkmate the opponent‚Äôs king, which means the king is under threat of capture and has no legal moves to escape.\n",
        "\n",
        "MOVEMENT RULES:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **King**\n",
        "   - Moves exactly one square in any direction (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal).\n",
        "   - Cannot move into check (a square threatened by an opponent's piece).\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Queen**\n",
        "   - Moves any number of squares vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.\n",
        "   - Cannot jump over other pieces.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Rook**\n",
        "   - Moves any number of squares vertically or horizontally.\n",
        "   - Participates in castling with the king.\n",
        "   - Cannot jump over other pieces.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Bishop**\n",
        "   - Moves any number of squares diagonally.\n",
        "   - Each bishop remains on the same color square it started on.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Knight**\n",
        "   - Moves in an L-shape: two squares in one direction and then one square perpendicular to that.\n",
        "   - Only piece that can jump over other pieces.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Pawn**\n",
        "   - Moves forward one square at a time.\n",
        "   - On its first move, a pawn can move forward two squares.\n",
        "   - Captures diagonally, one square forward left or right.\n",
        "   - Cannot move backward.\n",
        "\n",
        "SPECIAL MOVES:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Castling**\n",
        "   - A special move involving the king and one rook.\n",
        "   - King moves two squares toward the rook; the rook moves to the square next to the king.\n",
        "   - Conditions:\n",
        "     - Neither the king nor the rook involved has previously moved.\n",
        "     - There are no pieces between them.\n",
        "     - The king is not in check, does not move through check, and does not end in check.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **En Passant**\n",
        "   - A special pawn capture.\n",
        "   - If an opposing pawn moves two squares forward from its starting position and lands beside your pawn, you may capture it as if it had moved only one square forward.\n",
        "   - Must be done on the very next move.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Pawn Promotion**\n",
        "   - When a pawn reaches the 8th rank (last row), it must be promoted.\n",
        "   - The pawn can be converted into a queen, rook, bishop, or knight (most commonly a queen).\n",
        "   - This happens immediately and is not optional.\n",
        "\n",
        "ENDGAME CONDITIONS:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Check**\n",
        "   - A king is in check if it is under attack by an opponent‚Äôs piece.\n",
        "   - The player must respond to check by:\n",
        "     - Moving the king,\n",
        "     - Capturing the attacking piece,\n",
        "     - Blocking the attack with another piece.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Checkmate**\n",
        "   - A king is in check and there is no legal move to escape.\n",
        "   - This ends the game with a victory for the attacking player.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Stalemate**\n",
        "   - A player has no legal moves and is not in check.\n",
        "   - This results in a draw.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Draw by Insufficient Material**\n",
        "   - If neither player has sufficient pieces to force checkmate (e.g., king vs. king, or king and bishop vs. king).\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Draw by Threefold Repetition**\n",
        "   - If the same board position occurs three times with the same player to move, and all possible moves are the same each time.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Fifty-Move Rule**\n",
        "   - If 50 consecutive moves occur for both players without any pawn movement or capture, either player may claim a draw.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **Resignation**\n",
        "   - A player may concede defeat at any time.\n",
        "\n",
        "GENERAL NOTES:\n",
        "- Touch-Move Rule (in official tournaments): If you touch a piece, you must move it unless it has no legal move.\n",
        "- Illegal Moves: If an illegal move is noticed during play, the move must be taken back and a legal move made instead. Tournament rules may impose penalties.\n",
